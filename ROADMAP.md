# Pipeline Skill ROADMAP

## Priority Matrix

Active, selectable work. Priorities are a heuristic starting point — adjust freely.

| Priority | Feature | Why | Milestone |
|----------|---------|-----|-----------|

_No active tasks — v0.2.0 shipped (PRs #21–#26). Next milestone TBD; run `/pipeline-strategy` to plan v0.3.0._

## Milestones

_No active milestone. See `## Completed` for v0.2.0._

## Completed

- v0.2.0 — Pipeline hardening: branch-agnostic `run_auto` + literal guard (#11, #18, PR #21); three-dot diff mandate in pipeline-ship (#17, PR #22); lint scope-discipline + per-task coverage expectation (#5, #9, PR #23); hard programmatic retro-stage gate (#8, PR #24); pre-drain symbol staleness check (#7, PR #25); PR `#TBD` placeholder substitution (#6, PR #26). ✅ Shipped
- v0.1.0 — Branch-agnostic pipeline family + vendored, hardened `pipeline-init` (PR #10). ✅ Shipped
- v0.1.0 — Documented `/pipeline-init` across README, CLAUDE.md, and install.sh (PRs #12, #13, #14). ✅ Shipped
- v0.1.0 — Stage-5 enumerated-unit inventory gate in pipeline-shared + all four templates (PR #15). ✅ Shipped
- Foundation — instruction-rot rationale, learning-channel design, retro-artifact gate (PRs #1, #2). ✅ Shipped

## Future

- Publish/track the flexion plugin copy in lockstep with the canonical skills.
- A self-test harness that lints every `skills/*/SKILL.md` bash snippet for the branch-resolution chain drift.

## Contributing

Active work lives under `## Milestones` with a matching Priority Matrix row (byte-identical feature name). Shipped work moves to `## Completed`. `/pipeline-next` reads this file; keep the matrix header columns `Priority | Feature | Why | Milestone` and put milestones under a non-reserved `## ` heading.
